when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss then you completely delete your recurring alarm this is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it
